## Project Title: Secure OT Asset ad Telemetry Platform


## Project Purpose: 
The primary purpose of the project is to develop practical experience applying software security and cybersecurity engineering principles throughout the complete lifecycle of a realistic OT-oriented system.

The project is intended to demonstrate competence across several related disciplines:

- Secure software development
- Java and Spring Boot development
- Application security
- Identity and access management
- Device identity and authentication
- Secure API development
- MQTT and HTTP communications
- OT and IoT security architecture
- Threat modeling
- Security monitoring and auditability
- DevSecOps
- Software supply-chain security
- Security testing and remediation


## Problem Statement:
OT and IoT environments increasingly rely on connected devices, telemetry, remote management, and software-driven monitoring, but these systems can introduce security risks when identity, access control, data validation, logging, and device communications are not designed securely from the beginning.

This project addresses the need for a security-focused platform that can manage OT/IoT assets, authenticate users and devices, securely receive telemetry, enforce authorization, and provide monitoring and auditability.

The project will also address the broader software engineering problem of integrating security throughout the full development lifecycle rather than adding security controls after implementation is complete.

## Objectives:
- Apply a structured Secure SDLC from requirements through release.
- Design a secure and extensible OT/IoT asset and telemetry platform.
- Implement secure user and device authentication and authorization.
- Support secure telemetry ingestion through HTTP and MQTT.
- Provide security monitoring, audit logging, and alerting.
- Perform threat modeling, security testing, and remediation.
- Integrate DevSecOps practices including automated scanning and SBOM generation.
- Produce complete documentation and traceability for the system lifecycle.
- Build the platform so simulated devices can later be replaced with physical OT and embedded devices.

## High-Level Scope:
- OT/IoT asset registration and management
- User and device authentication
- Role-based access control
- HTTP and MQTT telemetry ingestion
- Telemetry validation, storage, and monitoring

- **System Administrators**  
    Manage users, devices, configuration, and platform operations.
- **Security Analysts**  
    Review security events, alerts, audit records, and system risks.
- **OT / Engineering Personnel**  
    Represent the operators and technical staff responsible for connected field devices and industrial systems.
- **End Users / Operators**  
    Use the platform to view assets, telemetry, device status, and operational information.
- **Future Developers / Maintainers**  
    Maintain, extend, and secure the platform after the initial release.
- **Project Evaluators / Academic Reviewers**  
    Review the project against software engineering, cybersecurity, and Secure SDLC objectives.
- **Future Organizations / Customers**  
    Utilities, industrial organizations, infrastructure operators, or other organizations that could eventually use or adapt the platform.

## Assumptions:
- Initial OT/IoT devices will be simulated using Python.
    
- Development and testing will occur in a controlled lab environment.
    
- The platform will use Java and Spring Boot as the primary backend technology.
    
- PostgreSQL, Keycloak, and Mosquitto will be available for local development and testing.
    
- Physical OT and embedded devices may be integrated later without requiring major redesign.
    
- The project will follow a Secure SDLC with security activities performed throughout each phase.
    
- Open-source development and security tools will be used where practical.

## Constraints:
- Project completion is targeted for March 2027.
- Approximately one dedicated workday per week will be available.
- Development is primarily being completed by one developer.
- The project must remain small enough to complete within the available schedule.
- Testing will be limited to lab and simulated environments rather than production OT systems.
- Advanced industrial protocols and production-scale infrastructure are outside the initial release.
- Security controls must be implemented with tools and infrastructure reasonably available in a personal development environment.
- Scope changes must not interfere with completion of the core Secure SDLC objectives.

## Security Goals:
- Ensure only authenticated users and devices can access the platform.
- Enforce least-privilege access through role-based authorization.
- Protect telemetry and management traffic in transit.
- Validate all incoming data before processing or storage.
- Protect credentials, secrets, and other sensitive configuration data.
- Maintain reliable audit records of security-relevant and administrative activity.
- Detect and record authentication failures, authorization failures, abnormal device behavior, and other security events.
- Reduce attack surface through secure configuration and dependency management.
- Integrate security testing and automated scanning throughout development.
- Maintain traceability between identified threats, security requirements, implemented controls, and verification results.
- Preserve availability and prevent security controls from creating unsafe behavior in future OT environments.
- Document residual risks and known limitations before release.


## Risks:
- **Scope Expansion**  
    Additional features or protocols could delay completion of the core project.
- **Limited Development Time**  
    One dedicated workday per week may restrict how much can be completed within the project schedule.
- **Integration Complexity**  
    Integrating Spring Boot, Keycloak, PostgreSQL, MQTT, and security tooling may introduce unexpected technical issues.
- **Security Design Gaps**  
    Incomplete requirements or architecture decisions could result in security controls being implemented incorrectly or too late.
- **Testing Limitations**  
    A lab-based environment may not reproduce all behaviors or risks found in production OT systems.
- **Technology Learning Curve**  
    Unfamiliar tools, protocols, or security technologies may slow development.
- **Dependency and Tooling Changes**  
    Updates to frameworks, libraries, scanners, or supporting infrastructure could require project changes.
- **Incomplete Threat Coverage**  
    Threat modeling may fail to identify all relevant attack paths or operational risks.
- **Single-Developer Dependency**  
    Design, implementation, testing, and documentation depend primarily on one developer, increasing schedule and review risk.
- **Schedule Slippage**  
    Missed weekly work sessions or unresolved blockers could push work beyond the March 2027 target
## Governance & SDLC
The project will follow a structured Secure Software Development Lifecycle with defined phases, deliverables, and exit criteria.

Project work will progress through:

- Project initiation and scope definition
- Requirements engineering
- Architecture and security design
- Threat modeling
- Detailed design and verification planning
- Secure implementation
- Security testing and remediation
- Release and final security assurance

Each phase must produce the required documentation or technical evidence before the project advances.

A weekly project review will be conducted every Saturday to evaluate completed work, identify incomplete deliverables, and determine whether phase exit criteria have been met.

Security requirements, architecture decisions, implementation components, and verification results will be maintained through requirements traceability.

Changes that materially affect scope, architecture, security requirements, or schedule will be documented and reviewed before being incorporated into the project baseline.

The project will prioritize completion of the defined core platform over optional features or future extensions.

## Approval and Success Criteria:
The project will be considered successful when the defined Secure SDLC phases have been completed and the core platform requirements have been implemented, tested, and documented.

Success criteria include:

- Required project documentation and SDLC artifacts are completed.
- Core functional and security requirements are implemented.
- User and device authentication operate as intended.
- Role-based authorization is enforced.
- HTTP and MQTT telemetry can be securely received and processed.
- Security events, audit records, and alerts are generated as required.
